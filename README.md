# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
RSA Factoring Challenge Project (Optional)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The RSA Factoring Challenge was a competition proposed by RSA Laboratories in March 1991 in order to promote research into computational number theory and the practical difficulty of factoring large integers, a problem at the core of RSA public-key cryptography.

The challenge published a list of semi-prime numbers (numbers that are the product of two prime numbers) of different lengths, ranging from 330 to 2048 bits. Prizes, ranging from $1,000 to $200,000, were offered to anyone who could factor any of the published semi-prime numbers.

Factoring large integers is a complex task and believed to be computationally difficult, which is the basis for the security of RSA and other public-key cryptosystems. If efficient factoring algorithms were developed, it could undermine the security of these systems.

The challenge was discontinued in 2007, with RSA Laboratories stating that "the industry has moved on", pointing to new challenges like elliptic curve cryptography. Several of the numbers on the list were factored before the challenge was discontinued, but as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the larger ones remain uncracked.

Background Context
Before you continue reading, start this song in the background :)




We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents. It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents.

This project is NOT mandatory at all. It is 100% optional. Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won’t get hurt if you don’t do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!
